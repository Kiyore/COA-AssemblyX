  <h1 class="header">üîπ x86 Architecture Overview</h1>

  <p class="subtext">
    The x86 architecture is a powerful and versatile instruction set developed by Intel and widely used in desktop and
    server processors. It belongs to the CISC (Complex Instruction Set Computer) category, offering a broad range of
    instructions that can execute complex tasks. This flexibility makes x86 suitable for both high-level applications
    and low-level hardware control.
  </p>

  <p class="subtext">
    At its core, x86 relies on several general-purpose registers, which are small but fast memory locations within the
    CPU. These registers temporarily hold data, counters, pointers, and return values. The eight primary
    registers‚Äî<code>EAX</code>, <code>EBX</code>, <code>ECX</code>, <code>EDX</code>, <code>ESP</code>,
    <code>EBP</code>, <code>ESI</code>, and <code>EDI</code>‚Äîplay specialized roles during execution.
  </p>

  <p class="subtext">
    The architecture supports various instruction types such as data movement (e.g., <code>MOV</code>), arithmetic
    operations (e.g., <code>ADD</code>, <code>SUB</code>), logic operations (e.g., <code>AND</code>, <code>OR</code>),
    and control flow (e.g., <code>JMP</code>, <code>CALL</code>). x86 also implements multiple addressing modes like
    immediate, register-based, direct, and indirect addressing‚Äîenabling flexible memory access.
  </p>

  <p class="subtext">
    Function calls in x86 follow a stack-based calling convention. Parameters are passed through the stack and
    registers, and the return address is also pushed onto the stack. This makes recursion and nested calls efficient and
    predictable, and allows functions to maintain local state through the base pointer.
  </p>
